I had ups and downs today.

First of all, I find it hard to apply HTML with JS. I think I tried to link some functions, like rest(), into the picture button. But the onCLick part was not recognizing JS. I have no clue why this happened. For that my html-pagina does only contain some pictures-buttons that ain’t work. 

- Do I have to make a separate function (for each button)to connect JS with HTML?  


I felt bad about it so decided to finish the functions. I succeed rest(), failed pickUpItem and almost succeed equipWeapon.


FAILED 
function pickUpItem(person, weapon) {
  weapon.push(inventory[0])

// SHOULD Add the weapon object as the last element of the inventory array of person, but the above line is not possible. Above solution is not working.

ALMOST ((First boolean is not working)

function equipWeapon(person) {
    if (person.inventory.length === 0)
  // if (person.inventory === undefined)

{return person;}
    else 
    {person.weapon = person.inventory[0];} 
    return person;



Good news is: THE REST FUNCTION IS WORKING!!! Now I need some rest myself.
